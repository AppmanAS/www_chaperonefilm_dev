What is a lifestyle movie? It's whatever you want it to be. It's a movie about your life, your lifestyle. This week we helped Anders, who is applying for his dream job. To make sure the employer sees it, and also gets an idea about the kind of work this man actually can do, we made a video where he shows his heart and skill that he has for the job. It got picked up by local media as well, and gained 13.000 views in one day.
