BALLOON OVER TRAKAI CASTLE, LITHUANIA
To see Trakai Castle in Lithuania from a helium balloon is truly a one of a kind experience. We organized the trip but chose to not go in the balloon. Instead we captured it from the ground and with a drone.

NORWEGIAN WEDDING
A wedding is the perfect story. Grand sets, amazing costumes, smiles and is love all around us. And a happy ending. Pictures are good, but a movie tell the story better.
