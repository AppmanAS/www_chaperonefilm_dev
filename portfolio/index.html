BALLOON OVER TRAKAI CASTLE, LITHUANIA
To see Trakai Castle in Lithuania from a helium balloon is truly a one of a kind experience. We organized the trip but chose to not go in the balloon. Instead we captured it from the ground and with a drone.

This client took a trip around Iceland on Highway 1. The trip was extreme and was captured for the client forever.
